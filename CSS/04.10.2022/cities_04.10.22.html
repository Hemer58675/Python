        <p id="kol">A city is a large human settlement. [1][2][a] It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with
            administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks. [3] Cities generally have
            extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, production of goods, and communication
            Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organisations and businesses, sometimes benefiting
            different parties in the process, such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution.</p>
